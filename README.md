# advent-of-code

This is a repo for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) puzzles and my solutions thereof.

The puzzles and solutions are stored in directories named after the year, language, and day. Hence, the puzzle and my corresponding solutions for 2024 day 1 using Rust is stored in `2024/rust/day-01`. Each puzzle tends to have multiple parts, so the 2024 day 1 solutions are split into `2024/rust/day-01/part-1` and `2024/rust/day-01/part-2`.
